# coding-quiz

Description: This is a coding quiz that allows users to answer 5 questions. Once they start quiz, they will start answering the quiz timed at 85 seconds. 

Once the user have answered the questions - they are then able to view their scores under view high score. 

In this project, I have added a nav bar using react boostrap where users are able to view their high scores or click on coding quiz to go back to the home page to start the quiz. 

Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback at jess.chen0502@gmail.com.
